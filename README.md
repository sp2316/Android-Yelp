This is an Android Application implmenting the yelp App with basic functionality in Java with Node.js as backend, which allows users to search for 
restaurants and businesses and look at detailed information about them.

Additionally, the users can schedule a reservation. Which they can review and also cancel if needed. These features  among others are spread out over multiple activities and fragments

It has the following features -
- Auto complete feature

- Displaying top 10 search results based on data given in the form.
- Displaying more information about the data selected from the search results (data fetched from Api Call)
- Embedding Maps
- Swipe to delete functionality and many more..

I have shown all the features in the link mentioned above..
